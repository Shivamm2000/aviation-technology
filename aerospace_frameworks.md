## Design and Development Frameworks:
 - Systems Engineering: Aerospace systems are often complex and involve various interconnected components. Systems engineering frameworks help manage the entire development process, ensuring that all aspects of
   the system work together seamlessly.

 - Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): MBSE uses models to represent the different aspects of a system and its components. It helps in visualising, analysing, and optimizing the design before physical
   prototypes are built.

 - Integrated Product Teams(IPT): IPT is an approach where cross-functional teams work collaboratively to design and develop aerospace systems. It encourages communication and coordination among different
   disciplines involved in the project.


## Safety and Reliability Frameworks:
 - Fault Tolerance and Redundancy: Aerospace systems often incorporate redundancy and fault-tolerant design to enhance safety and reliability. Frameworks for fault tree analysis are commonly used.
